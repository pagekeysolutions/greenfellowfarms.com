		<p>
			Rabbit is an all white meat that is higher in protein than any other comparable meat. Rabbit meat is a natural way of providing amino acids, vitamin B12, calcium, and is very low in cholesterol. This combination of jam packed nutrients helps your dog maintain its natural state. Also, when fed a raw diet, the meaty bones are our dog's natural toothbrushes. The action of crunching, tearing, and pulling not only provides dogs with a sense of satisfaction but also sustains dental health. As you can see, there is no better way to provide a dog with a great carnivorous diet.
		</p>
		<h3>Rabbit manure:</h3>
		<p>
			This stuff is remarkable. It comes nicely packaged in a convenient, round, dry, pelleted form. As a fertilizer, fresh rabbit manure is approximately 2% nitrogen, 1% phosphorus and 1% potassium. Use it fresh on the garden for it will not burn plants. Use the small marbles to top-dress your lawn, or mulch roses, vegetables or flower beds. Or supercharge your compost pile and create an earthworm population explosion. This is definitely magic at its finest. 
		</p>
		<h3>Fur:</h3>
		<p>
			The New Zealand white rabbits have fantastic fur that makes it very suitable for clothing. It can be easily dyed many different colors and makes it very valuable in the fur trade. Rabbits with high grades of fur are used to make fur coats and fur trimmings. The lower grades are used to make felt hats and glove linings.
