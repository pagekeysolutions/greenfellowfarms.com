		<h3>Rabbit manure:</h3>
		<p>
			This stuff is remarkable. It comes nicely packaged in a convenient, round, dry, pelleted form. As a fertilizer, fresh rabbit manure is approximately 2% nitrogen, 1% phosphorus and 1% potassium. Use it fresh on the garden for it will not burn plants. Use the small marbles to top-dress your lawn, or mulch roses, vegetables or flower beds. Or supercharge your compost pile and create an earthworm population explosion. This is definitely magic at its finest. 
		</p>
		<h3>Fur:</h3>
		<p>
			The New Zealand white rabbits have fantastic fur that makes it very suitable for clothing. It can be easily dyed many different colors and makes it very valuable in the fur trade. Rabbits with high grades of fur are used to make fur coats and fur trimmings. The lower grades are used to make felt hats and glove linings.
